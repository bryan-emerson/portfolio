# Welcome to my Portfolio Repo!

This webpage is a React App showcasing my abilities to potential employers. Project cards on the projects page are programmatically created from an array of objects containing relevant data. The cards are then conditionally rendered based to the data in the related object. React router was used to provide the user with different views.
