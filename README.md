# Welcome to my Portfolio Repo!

![portfolio webpage photo](./src/images/portfolio.png)

This webpage is a React App showcasing my abilities to potential employers. Project cards on the projects page are programmatically created from an array of objects containing relevant data. The cards are then conditionally rendered based on the data in the related object. React router was used to provide the user with different views. An Express server was implemented to facilitate deployment on Heroku. Enjoy!
