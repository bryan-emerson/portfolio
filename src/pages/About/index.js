These skills facilitate my excellent communication skills with customers to meet expectations. My technical foundation was built from four yearâ€™s extensive computer science experience as an Information Technician in the United States Navy. These combined experiences in computer science and customer relations forged an exemplary foundation for being a web developer that is able to meet customer expectations.
